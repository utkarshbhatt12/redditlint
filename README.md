## A free code formatting tool

A code formatting tool from anonymous on Reddit.

I found this project while browsing Reddit and it looks like the original creator has abandoned this project. I’m updating it with better styles and giving it a new life.

### Running Redditlint

* Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and `node http-server` using the following commands
`npm install http-server –g`

* Check the [http-server documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

* Navigate to your projects directory and use git clone to make a copy.
`git clone https://github.com/utkarshbhatt12/redditlint`

* `cd` to the `redditlint` folder and type the following
`http-server .`

The node live server will start with a visible http URL for you to visit the tool.
